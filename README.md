# Sophia-Pallas
Sophia Pallas is a high-efficiency fine-tuning library designed for the JAX/TPU ecosystem.  While libraries like Unsloth optimize for CUDA, Sophia Pallas leverages the XLA compiler and Pallas kernels to bring "Unsloth-like" memory efficiency to Google Colab TPUs and Cloud TPU v5 pods.  Zero-Dependency on CUDA.  Pure JAX/Flax implementation.
